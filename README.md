## **File Landing Page**
\
For this project, I created a landing page for a PowerPoint file download. The website is fully responsive and includes a mobile menu for a better user experience.I'm proud of how this project turned out, and it gave me a chance to practice my HTML and CSS skills. I'm looking forward to taking on more web development projects in the future.
